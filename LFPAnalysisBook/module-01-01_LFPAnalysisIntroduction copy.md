# Introduction to LFP Analysis

The LFPAnalysis codebase is meant to help you get data from its raw, recorded format to a reuseable, pre-processed Python object that you can then subject to easily replicable analyses. 

You can find installation instructions here: [Repository](https://github.com/seqasim/LFPAnalysis).
